## About me


Current postbaccalaureate IRTA at the National Institutes of Mental Health, in the [Data Science and Sharing Team](https://cmn.nimh.nih.gov/dsst) and [Machine Learning Team](https://cmn.nimh.nih.gov/mlt), working on:

* Machine learning models for predicting longitudinal mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic
* Detecting context-dependent changes in encoding from longitudinal neural recording activity
* 3D pose estimation & unsupervised classification of animal behavior in video
* Data sharing & transparency by improving standardization of two-photon and holographic photostimulation archival data formats


## Education

I graduated *magna cum laude* from Dartmouth College in June 2021, with a double major in applied mathematics and neuroscience (high honors) and a minor in economics. I worked on research related to adaptive learning and decision making under uncertainty in [Alireza Soltani's lab](http://ccnl.dartmouth.edu/), and on projects related to animal tracking and behavior classification in [Peter Tse's octpus lab](https://sites.dartmouth.edu/peter/). I was also on the men's [Varsity Lightweight Rowing](https://dartmouthsports.com/sports/rowing) team.
